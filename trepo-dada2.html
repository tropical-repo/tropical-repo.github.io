<h2 id="rename-samples">Rename samples</h2>
<p>First, we need to setup the working environment by renaming the fastq files and defining a path for the working directory. To make the parsing easier, we will eliminate the lane and well number from each sample. If you do not wish to do that you will need to adjust the code accordingly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CAUTION. You should check that this code works on a few backup files before proceeding.</p>

<p>Before we start the DADA2 workflow we need to run <a href="https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt">catadapt</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="martin2011cutadapt">(Martin <a href="#ref-martin2011cutadapt" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> on all <code>fastq.gz</code> files to trim the primers. For this part of the study we used the primer pair 505F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) <span class="citation" data-cites="caporaso2011global">(Caporaso et al. <a href="#ref-caporaso2011global" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> which should yield an amplicon length of about 253 bp.</p>
<p>First we define the primers.</p>

<p>Next, we check the presence and orientation of these primers in the data. I started doing this for ITS data because of primer read-through but I really like the general idea of doing it just to make sure nothing funny is going of with the data.</p>
<p>To do this we will create all orientations of the input primer sequences. In other words the <em>Forward</em>, <em>Complement</em>, <em>Reverse</em>, and <em>Reverse Complement</em> variations.</p>

<p>Nice. Time to assess the number of times a primer (and all possible primer orientation) appear in the forward and reverse reads. According to the workflow, counting the primers on one set of paired end fastq files is sufficient to see if there is a problem. This assumes that all the files were created using the same library prep. Basically for both primers, we will search for all four orientations in both forward and reverse reads. Since this is 16S rRNA we do not anticipate any issues but it is worth checking.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>. If the code above removes all of the base pairs in a sequence, you will get downstream errors unless you set the <code>-m</code> flag. This flag sets the minimum length and reads shorter than this will be discarded. Without this flag, reads of length 0 will be kept and cause issues. <em>Also, a lot of output will be written to the screen by cutadapt!</em>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-error-rates">Learn Error Rates</h2>
<p>Now it is time to assess the error rate of the data. The DADA2 algorithm uses a parametric error model. Every amplicon data set has a different set of error rates and the <code>learnErrors</code> method learns this error model <em>from the data</em>. It does this by alternating estimation of the error rates and inference of sample composition until they converge on a jointly consistent solution. The algorithm begins with an initial guess, for which the maximum possible error rates in the data are used.</p>

<p>The error rates for each possible transition (A to C, A to G, etc.) are shown. Points are the observed error rates for each consensus quality score. The black line shows the estimated error rates after convergence of the machine-learning algorithm. The red line shows the error rates expected under the nominal definition of the Q-score. Here the estimated error rates (black line) are a good fit to the observed rates (points), and the error rates drop with increased quality as expected.</p>

<h1 id="dada2-asv-inference">3. DADA2 &amp; ASV Inference</h1>
<p>At this point we are ready to apply the core sample inference algorithm (dada) to the filtered and trimmed sequence data. DADA2 offers three options for whether and how to pool samples for ASV inference.</p>
<p>If <code>pool = TRUE</code>, the algorithm will pool together all samples prior to sample inference.<br />
If <code>pool = FALSE</code>, sample inference is performed on each sample individually.<br />
If <code>pool = "pseudo"</code>, the algorithm will perform pseudo-pooling between individually processed samples.</p>
<p>For our final analysis, we chose <code>pool = pseudo</code> for this data set.</p>

<p>As an example, we can inspect the returned <code>dada-class</code> object for the forward and reverse reads from the sample #2:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<pre><code>dada-class: object describing DADA2 denoising results
2802 sequence variants were inferred from 15266 input unique sequences.

<p>This output tells us how many true sequence variants the DADA2 algorithm inferred from the unique sequences, in this case the sample 2.</p>

<p><small><em>Distribution of read lengths by number of samples.</em></small></p>
<p>The sequence table is a matrix with rows corresponding to (and named by) the samples, and columns corresponding to (and named by) the sequence variants. We have 119067 sequence variants but also a range of sequence lengths. Since many of these sequence variants are singletons or doubletons, we will just select a range that corresponds to the expected amplicon length and eliminate the spurious reads.</p>
<aside>
The values you select should be based on the sequence table generated above.

<h1 id="remove-chimeras">5. Remove Chimeras</h1>
<p>Even though the <code>dada</code> method corrects substitution and indel errors, chimeric sequences remain. According to the DADA2 documentation, the accuracy of sequence variants after denoising makes identifying chimeric ASVs simpler than when dealing with fuzzy OTUs. Chimeric sequences are identified if they can be <em>exactly reconstructed</em> by combining a left-segment and a right-segment from two more abundant <em>parent</em> sequences.</p>

<p>Chimera checking removed an additional 69692 sequence variants however, when we account for the abundances of each variant, we see chimeras accounts for about 11.81104% of the merged sequence reads. Not bad.</p>

<h1 id="assign-taxonomy">6. Assign Taxonomy</h1>
<p>The <code>assignTaxonomy</code> command implements the naive Bayesian classifier, so for reproducible results you need to set a random number seed (see issue <a href="https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2/issues/538">#538</a>). We did this at the beginning of the workflow. For taxonomic assignment, we are using the Silva version 138 <span class="citation" data-cites="quast2012silva">(Quast et al. <a href="#ref-quast2012silva" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. The developers of DADA2 maintain a <a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html">formatted version of the database</a>.</p>
<p>We will read in the <code>RDS</code> file containing the sequence table saved above. We also need to run <code>remove(list = ls())</code> command, otherwise the final image we save will be huge. This way, the image only contains the sample data, seqtab, and taxtab <em>after</em> running <code>removeBimeraDenovo</code>.</p>
